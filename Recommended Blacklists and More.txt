#                     --- Recommended Blacklists and More ---
# Provided here are links to good blacklists for basic DNS-blocking functionality
# I'll provide comments to better explain what every individual link is
# This file however will not act to block any domains, you're gonna have to put in some work here
# If you see this, follow my twitter (@blyatbeauty) and say ayy, lmao

firebog.net
# An excellent place to start, especially on a fresh pi-hole install.
# Simply copy all the links that have a green tick (âœ”) into the Adlist group management tab on your pihole
# In case you didn't know, you can paste multiple adlist links at once into the Adlist group management, which will make your life much easier.

Regular Expressions (RegEx)
# RegEx allows pihole to not just rely on your blocklists but also to automatically block websites as long as they meet certain criteria.
# I don't do coding or anything on a regular basis, if you want a better explanation, find it on youtube or something
# These are the basic RegEx you should have in a fresh pi-hole install
# You will have to copy these in one-by-one however
