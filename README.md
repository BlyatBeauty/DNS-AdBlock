# DNS-AdBlock
This is a primarily YouTube-based blacklist for DNS-based adblockers such as pi-hole.

Honestly, I'm really just using this for my personal devices but if happens to help you out, then that's pretty cool!

This should definitely not be your only blocklist, I highly suggest the lists over at firebog.net.

The Youtube Blacklist primarily consists of google domains that have caused me issues. Unfortunately, due to the nature of YouTube's content delivery setup, the domains I blocked are not all of YouTube's ad domains. 
The Miscellaneous Blacklist consists of non-google domains that have tried to ruin my browsing experience. It borrows heavily from the default adlists from the Adblock app by Futuremind for iOS, and anything borrowed from there is specified via comments.

The Recommended Blacklists and More file provides links to good blacklists, and are my recommendations for setting up a fresh pi-hole install. Why my repo is your first exposure to DNS-based adblocking is beyond me, but I tried to make the instructions as simple as can be. Unlike the Youtube Blacklist and Miscellaneous Blacklist, you will actually have to open and read it to use it. Tragic, I know.

Anywho, if you happen to use this or fork this, feel free to let me know over at @blyatbeauty on twitter.
