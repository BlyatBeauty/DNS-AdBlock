# DNS-AdBlock
This is a primarily YouTube-based blacklist for DNS-based adblockers such as pi-hole.

Honestly, I'm really just using this for my personal devices but if happens to help you out, then that's pretty cool!

This should definitely not be your only blocklist, I highly suggest the lists over at firebog.net.

The Youtube Blacklist primarily consists of google domains that have caused me issues. Unfortunately, due to the nature of YouTube's content delivery setup, the domains I blocked are not all of YouTube's ad domains. 
The Miscellaneous Blacklist consists of non-google domains that have tried to ruin my browsing experience. It borrows heavily from the default adlists from the Adblock app by Futuremind for iOS, and anything borrowed from there is specified via comments.

The Recommended Blacklists and More file is essentially an extension of this readme, providing links to good blacklists (like firebog.net) as well as the known Pegasus Spyware domains as found by AmnestyTech. There will also be some useful regex filters to put in place if this is somehow your first exposure to DNS-based adblocking.

If you happen to use this or fork this, feel free to let me know over at @blyatbeauty on twitter.
