# DNS-AdBlock
This is a primarily YouTube-based blacklist for DNS-based adblockers such as pi-hole.

Honestly, I'm really just using this for my personal devices but if happens to help you out, then that's pretty cool!

This should definitely not be your only blocklist, I highly suggest the lists over at firebog.net.

The Youtube Blacklist primarily consists of google domains that have caused me issues. Meanwhile the Miscellaneous Blacklist consists of non-google domains that have tried to ruin my browsing experience.

If you happen to use this or fork this, feel free to let me know over at @blyatbeauty on twitter.
